class ThresholdDecoder:
    """
    Decode raw network output into a relatively linear threshold using
    This works by estimating the logit normal distribution of network
    activations using a series of averages and standard deviations to
    calculate a cumulative probability distribution

    Args:
        mu_stds: tuple of pairs of (mean, standard deviation) that model the positive network output
        center: proportion of activations that a threshold of 0.5 indicates. Pass as None to disable decoding
        resolution: precision of cumulative sum estimation. Increases memory usage
        min_z: Minimum z score to generate in distribution map
        max_z: Maximum z score to generate in distribution map

    Background:
    We could simply take the output of the neural network as the confidence of a given
    prediction, but this typically jumps quickly between 0.01 and 0.99 even in cases where
    the network is less confident about a prediction. This is a symptom of the sigmoid squashing
    high values to values close to 1. This ThresholdDecoder measures the average output of
    the network over a dataset and uses that to create a smooth distribution so that an output
    of 80% means that the network output is greater than roughly 80% of the dataset
